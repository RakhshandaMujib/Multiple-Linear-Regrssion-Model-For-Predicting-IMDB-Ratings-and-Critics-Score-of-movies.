# Multiple-Linear-Regrssion-Model-For-Predicting-IMDB-Ratings-and-Critics-Score-of-movies.
 This project answers the question if or not the MPAA rating of a movie affects its audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. It also defines, diagnoses, interprets and tests multiple linear regression models for predicting the IMDB ratings and Critics scores on Rotten Tomatoes for a given movie. It tests the reliability of both the models and is concluded with a final comparison of the two. <br />
